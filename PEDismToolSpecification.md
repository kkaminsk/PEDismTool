# PE DISM Tool Application Specification

## 1. Introduction
The PE DISM Tool is a PowerShell-based application designed for easy mounting and unmounting of Windows Imaging Format (WIM) files. It primarily focuses on quick and efficient Windows Preinstallation Environment (PE) customization.

## 2. System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows (version to be specified)
- PowerShell: Version 5.1 or higher
- DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool: Must be available on the system

## 3. Application Overview
The PE DISM Tool provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to mount, modify, and unmount WIM images using DISM commands.

## 4. Functionality

### 4.1 Application Startup
- The application must run with administrator privileges.
- On launch, check for the existence of the folder `C:\WinPE\mount`. If it doesn't exist, create it.

### 4.2 WIM File Selection
- Allow the user to select a boot.wim file.
- Default path: `C:\osdcloud\testosd\media\sources\boot.wim`
- Default index: 1 (user should be able to change this if needed)

### 4.3 Mount Directory
- Default mount directory: `C:\WinPE\mount`
- Provide an option for the user to change the mount directory

### 4.4 Mounting WIM Image
- Provide a button to mount the selected WIM image.
- Use the following DISM command:
  ```
  dism /mount-wim /wimfile:"<selected_wim_file>" /index:<selected_index> /mountdir:"<mount_directory>"
  ```
- Example:
  ```
  dism /mount-wim /wimfile:"C:\osdcloud\TestOSD\Media\sources\boot.wim" /index:1 /mountdir:"C:\WinPE\mount"
  ```

### 4.5 Unmounting WIM Image
- Provide a button to unmount the image.
- Before unmounting, warn the administrator to close all open applications related to the mount directory, including Windows Explorer, Command Prompt, and editor applications.
- Use the following DISM command to unmount and commit changes:
  ```
  dism /unmount-wim /mountdir:"<mount_directory>" /commit
  ```

### 4.6 Error Handling
- If an error occurs during unmounting, provide the user with two options:
  1. Discard changes:
     ```
     dism /unmount-wim /mountdir:"<mount_directory>" /discard
     ```
  2. Clean up the WIM:
     ```
     dism /cleanup-wim
     ```
- After discarding changes or cleaning up, instruct the user to re-mount the WIM and make their changes again.

## 5. User Interface
- Design a simple and intuitive GUI with the following elements:
  - WIM file selection input (with browse button)
  - Index selection dropdown
  - Mount directory input (with browse button)
  - "Mount WIM" button
  - "Unmount WIM" button
  - Status display area for operation feedback
  - Error message display area

## 6. Logging
- Implement logging functionality to record all operations and errors.
- Save logs in a designated folder for troubleshooting purposes.

## 7. Security Considerations
- Ensure that the application runs with the least privileges necessary.
- Implement input validation to prevent command injection attacks.

## 8. Performance
- Optimize the application to handle large WIM files efficiently.
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations.

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple WIM file formats.
- Implement a feature to view and modify the contents of mounted WIM images.
- Create a task scheduler for automated WIM mounting and unmounting.
- Develop a plugin system for extending functionality.

## 10. Testing
- Develop a comprehensive test plan covering all functionalities.
- Perform thorough testing on various Windows versions and with different WIM files.

## 11. Documentation
- Create user documentation explaining how to use the application.
- Provide administrator documentation for deployment and troubleshooting.

## 12. Support and Maintenance
- Establish a process for user feedback and bug reporting.
- Plan for regular updates and maintenance of the application.
